1) Who & Critique (4 times)

1. My older sister and I both think that the picture would look better if the green was white. We think that the colors would flow together better.

2. My mom thinks that the white would look better if it was a bit softer and more cream like. She thinks that it will make the picture feel more homey.

3. My dad thinks that the parts that are cream should be yellow and that the parts that are yellow should be cream because yellow makes the picture seem less subtle than cream does.

4. My little sister thinks that the parts that are pink should be a lighter pink because the pink looks too red, so it takes over the picture too much.
